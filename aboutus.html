<h1>Electronics & Communication Engineering</h1>
<p>
   <h2> Overview</h2>
The Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering was established in the year 2012.Electronics and Communication Engineering
 is both a core subject and a swiftly advancing field, with new ideas emerging every day. From mobile phones to remote sensing, there 
 are exciting avenues to explore. With technology becoming all pervasive in everyday life, opportunities for electronic engineers are
  plenty.

The department of Electronics & Communication Engineering has faculty members with a blend of youth and experience. Faculty<br>
 members of this department have considerable academic, industrial and research experience. The department has specialists in the <br>
 fields of Electronics, Communication Systems, VLSI Design, Wireless and Mobile Communication, Medical Electronics and in various other<br>
  fields. The department is well known for imparting a strong theoretical and practical foundation in the subject. It has well equipped<br>
state of art laboratories. Power point presentations and regular assignments are used to in still in the student a thorough grasp of <br>
the fundamentals. With the support of faculty having industrial experience, students are familiarized with cutting edge research and<br>
 industrial requirements. Besides strong academic inputs, the students are encouraged to do mini projects and gain hands on experience <br>
 with the hardware and software tools. The department understands the needs of the industry and strives to produce quality engineers <br>
 with professional orientation. The ambition of the department is to provide quality education and up to date information to the students,<br>
  so that they find a place in the fast changing industry.<br>

Seminars and Technical symposiums are conducted regularly to keep abreast with the latest trends in the industry. Technical exhibitions <br>
and workshops are also conducted to provide exposure into real time applications. Visits to industry and guest lectures by eminent professional<br>
 from the industry add another dimension to the teaching learning experience. The department not only imparts training in technical skills, it <br>
 also tries to cultivate ethical values among the students. Students are also encouraged to participate in co-curricular and extracurricular activities,<br>
  which are so crucial in developing their soft skills and boosting confidence levels.<br>

<h2>Objectives</h2>
Professional Enhancement: To develop in the students the ability to acquire the knowledge of Mathematics, Science and engineering<br>
 and apply it professionally with in realistic constrain such as economic, social, ethical, health, safety, manufacturability and <br>
 sustainability with due ethical responsibility.<br>

<h2>Capacities</h2> 

To provide ability to identify, formulate and solve engineering problems with hands on experience in various technologies using <br>
modern tools necessary for engineering practice to satisfy the need of society and industries.<br>

<h2>Technical Capacities</h2>

To equip the students with the ability to design, experiment, analyze and interpret in their core applications through the multidisciplinary<br>
 concepts and contemporary learning to build them into industries ready graduates.<br>

<h2>Professionalism</h2>

To provide training, exposure and awareness on importance skill for better carrier and holistic personality development as well as <br>
professional attitude towards ethical issues, teamwork, multidisciplinary approach and capability to relate engineering issues to boarder<br>
 social context.<br>

<h2>Learning Atmosphere</h2>

To provide students with the academic environment and them aware of excellence, leadership, written ethical codes and guidelines<br>
 and the life-long learning to become successful professional in Electronics and communication engineering.<br>
